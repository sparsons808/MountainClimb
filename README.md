# MountainClimb
## Background
MountainClimb is a platforming game, where the player is trying to escape from the inside of a mountain as lava rises. In MountainClimb the player will have to get through all the levels to win. Players start with three lives, if the players fall one of players lives are taken and the player must start bakc at the begining of the level they are currently on. As the player moves through each level lava rises from the floor, if the plays is touched by the lave they loose a life and must again start the the begining of the level they are on. If the player looses all three of their lives the game is over and the player must start again.

## Functionality & MVP:

MountainClimb will include:

- Start game by pressing a start button
- Game instructions that will pop up as a modal
- Player will use the arrow keys to move the climber

## Timeline
 
 - Friday: Research on platforming games and how to impliment a game loop and engine
 - Sunday: Finsh Research and start designing game with Canvas
 - Monday: start getting the game logic down and getting a block to move on the page
 - Tuesday: Figure out the collision logic so that the block or sprite doesnt fall through the floor
 - Wednesday: Finish game logic and player controll
 - Thursday: Finish all styling that still needs to be completed.
 
 ## Bonus
 
 - If there is time I would like to add objects that the player can collect to add lives.
 - Allow users to change the size of the screen
